Updates based on prody 1.10.10 - 10/08/2020
CAVIAR modifications of ProDy:

 + keep parsing capacities
 - delete everything else
 + small modifications of pdb header parser

 - basically, we want to keep prody.proteins and supporting functionalities
proteins import atomic, measure, sequence, utilities, trajectory
and external exports: KDTree and CEAlign (cpp in code to compile)
and external exports: Biopython, blastpdb

Originally we took out almost everything except the PDB and PDB header parser
On next release, we want the mmcif parser, which in turn requires adding few stuff, especially since the code evolved since 2018
Maybe some other functionalities could be relevant: secondary structure assignment, trajectory parser, alignment


atomic is OK, but imports KDTree
measure could be ok, but imports KDTree and trajectory
sequence is horrible, imports too much, better to get rid of it
utilities is OK, but needs to be trimmed out because some fishy imports
See if we need CEAlign?



 - all the *blast* from proteins
 - also compare.py from proteins: these functions all relate to proteins with different sequences, we dont need or want that
and theres spurious circular imports
=> Actually compare.py can be useful, so we reintegrate it while trying to inactivate (sequence.py) MSA calls
 - same with pdbclusters.py

=> we can eliminate "sequence"
we're left with atomic, measure, utilities, trajectory

Atomic: we keep everything. We need KDTree for it.
Measure: we keep everything. It needs trajectory!
Utilities: get rid of catchall (philogenetic trees), TreeConstructio: both use Biopython
also took out drawtree function in drawtools.py
and imported iupacdata from biopython https://raw.githubusercontent.com/biopython/biopython/master/Bio/Data/IUPACData.py
as iupacdata.py in utilties


Now comes the hard part:
If we want trajectory module, we also need the ensemble module.
Ensemble has calls to MSA and Sequence in pdbensemble.py... Let's try to delete these components and see if that works
